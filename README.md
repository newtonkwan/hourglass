# Duke Minutes
A no-nonsense, minute by minute visualization of my life as a student at Duke University

## Motivation 
Think back to your days as a undergraduate. The days of hammocks, late nights, and mispent youth. After tracking every minute of every day of my senior fall semester, I'm going to visualize my story. These are my **Duke Minutes**.
