# M&M Minutes: Duke
A no-nonsense, minute by minute visualization of my life as a student at Duke University

## Motivation 
Think back to your days as a undergraduate. The days of hammocks, late nights, and mispent youth. After tracking every minute of every day of my senior fall semester, I'm going to show the **Duke M&M Minutes**: Moments and Memories through the Minutes.
