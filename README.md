# Toggl Duke
A no-nonsense, minute by minute visualization of my life as a student at Duke University

## Motivation 
Think back to your days as a undergraduate. The days of hammocks, late nights, and mispent youth. After tracking every minute of every day of my senior fall semester from arriving the week before to the walk back to my dorm for the last time, I'm going to show you my moments, memories, and minutes of Duke. This is my Duke story.
